# HTML to PDF Guide

This repository is a simple resource for developers who need to convert HTML into PDF.  
It outlines the common approaches, the challenges involved, and the tools available today.

If you are exploring ways to generate PDFs from HTML for invoices, reports, certificates or automated document creation, this guide is a starting point.

## Why HTML to PDF?

HTML and CSS give you full control over layout, typography and branding.  
PDF output makes that layout portable and print ready.

Developers commonly use HTML to PDF workflows for:

- invoices and receipts  
- reports and analytics summaries  
- quotes and proposals  
- tickets and passes  
- certificates  
- any document that needs consistent rendering

## Common Approaches

There are several ways to convert HTML into PDF.

### 1. Headless Browser Rendering
Tools such as Chromium and Puppeteer emulate a real browser and generate highly accurate PDFs.

### 2. Dedicated Rendering Engines
Tools such as WeasyPrint or wkhtmltopdf run server side and convert HTML into PDF files.

### 3. Hosted Services and APIs
Ideal if you want reliable rendering without maintaining binaries, font packs or complex dependencies.
